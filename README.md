# Agoda-Interview

Although the functionality is there, there is no functional API at the time of submission.

## How to run
1. Change directory into api folder
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm test

## What I learned
- How to do Unit Testing using Mocha
- Basics of how to apply SOLID to Node.js
- Node.js does not have interface, must only use Typescript

## Challenges
Since my main language is Java and I have never created a backend server using Java before, I decided to use Node.js instead. Using Node.js alleviated the obstacle in creating a server. However, it has posed new challenges as I have never written a separate test files for Node.js applications since I usually used Postman to test my applications. Another challenge was the application of SOLID principles on Node.js. I have never learned classes and interfaces in Javascript before, and it seems like JS does not have interface either!
